# About Me (AtHeartEngineer)

## The Name

I chose the username "AtHeartEngineer" not because I consider myself an authority on the subject, or that I have any title of "engineer", I'm self taught and don't proclaim to know the right way to do a lot of things. I chose my psuedonym because it is how I think. I've always been curious of how things work, how they are built, and the process of it all, to the point of driving my mom nuts when I was growing up.

## The Logo

  width="96"

The logo was made by someone on fiverr, it generally gets across the point. I have multiple versions of it, including an svg that I painstakingly made from scratch, but the colors/texture doesn't pop the same, so I don't use it. Not necessarily a night of wasted time, now I know how to craft svgs.

## This site

This is a [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) site that was created with the [gatsby-gitbook-starter](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/starters/hasura/gatsby-gitbook-starter) and then was highly butchered into what you see now.

It is a staticly generated react site, which autobuilds using github's actions and then deploys to google cloud hosting.
