# About Me (AtHeartEngineer)

<i>Everything is a work in progress</i>

## The Name

I chose the username "AtHeartEngineer" not because I consider myself an authority on the subject, or that I have any title of "engineer", I'm self taught and don't proclaim to know the right way to do a lot of things. I chose my psuedonym because it is how I think. I've always been curious of how things work, how they are built, and the process of it all, to the point of driving my mom nuts when I was growing up.

## The Logo

The logo was made by someone on fiverr, it generally gets across the point. I have multiple versions of it, including an svg that I painstakingly made from scratch, but the colors/texture doesn't pop the same, so I don't use it. Not necessarily a night of wasted time, now I know how to craft svgs.

## This site

This is a [mdbook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/index.html/) site that I've themed. I started out with gatsby, but it was just a mess, the code wasn't clean, the process wasn't clean, and it was took much for just getting words out there.

It is a staticly generated, which autobuilds using github's actions and then deploys to google cloud hosting.
