I've never made a game before, and I've always wanted to, so here we go.

I am going to start out messing around with a side scroller, or maybe a tower defense game. Eventually I would like to make it multiplayer using libp2p (decentralized/serverless) and possibly gundb (saves state for everyone, where the game would be persistent).
