# Explaining Github

- GitHub is a service that hosts code for developers. To track the changes to the code by developers, a software called git is used, created by Linus Torvalds, also the creator of Linux.
- Every git project is a repository of code, with history. This is known as version control.
- GitHub {user | org} / {repo}
- If you found yourself on one of these pages, you might be looking for the releases section where you can download a compiled or built application or tool.
- Show the releases page with artifacts
- Show the readme section for installation instructions
- Show the info section on the top right with website/license etc
- Stars/forks/recent commits/# contributors = engagement/stability/reliability
- Show the git history to see how active the repo is
- Show insights to show activity over time
- Explain what branches are (side projects)
