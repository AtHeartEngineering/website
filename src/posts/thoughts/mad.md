Deep down, I'm mad at the world.

I'm mad that the world isn't better than it is. This is what gives me my fire, my drive. I'm not sure if it's because I'm Irish, or it was how I was raised, or this is just common in some people.

That thought has popped in my head a few times recently so I thought I would write it down. It's not like I'm angry at anyone, or that I'm in a bad mood, I'm just... Unsatisfied with how things are, knowing what they could be.
