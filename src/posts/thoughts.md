title: Thoughts on things
description: My thoughts on things I'm interested in or working on or whatever I feel like writing about at the time. I'm not an authority on anything, I'm just a curious person. I'm self taught and don't proclaim to know the right way to do a lot of things. I chose my psuedonym because it is how I think. I've always been curious of how things work, how they are built, and how they are designed. I'm just here to share my thoughts and experiences. I'm not here to tell you how to do things, I'm here to share my thoughts and experiences. I'm not here to tell you how to do things, I'm here to share my thoughts and experiences.
