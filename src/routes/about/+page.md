# About Me (AtHeartEngineer)

<i>Everything is a work in progress</i>

## The Name

I chose the username "AtHeartEngineer" not because I consider myself an authority on the subject, or that I have any title of "engineer", I'm self taught and don't proclaim to know the right way to do a lot of things. I chose my psuedonym because it is how I think. I've always been curious of how things work, how they are built, and how they are designed.

## The Plan

- Document my thoughts and technical adventures
